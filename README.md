# FinalProject
CIT 336 Final Project Web Application
Simple web application that has the "C" and "R" in "CRUD" (Create, Read, Update, Destroy).
These four functions are the basis for many, many apps.  
  Create -> Insert
  Read -> Select
  Update -> Update
  Destroy -> Delete

This application allows users to enter exercises that work on the Abs, Arms, Legs and Chest. It also displays the users input.
Used MAMP to host the local server and MySQL database.
